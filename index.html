                    This website runs a scrolling test, which was developed by <a href="https://chenchaoran1234.wixsite.com/mysite" target="_blank">Chaoran Chen</a> for the CMU HCII class <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/uicourse/05440inter2022/" target="_blank">05-440/640: Interaction Techniques</a>, Spring, 2022.
                    <br /><br />
                    On the next page, please enter the details of the device you are testing.
                    <br /><br />
                    Your goal is to tap or land the "XXX" or certain line into the grey area as QUICKLY and as ACCURATELY as possible. For consistency, be sure to interact the same way throughout the test. Please do not to change the orientation of the device or resize the window.
